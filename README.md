      <ul>
        <li>Automatically flag or categorize suspected spam calls and messages</li>
        <li>Review a dedicated spam inbox for SMS and emails</li>
        <li>Quickly block repeat offenders and report spam</li>
        <li>Keep your main inbox and call history clean and focused</li>
      </ul>
      <blockquote>
        <em>Note:</em> Permissions are required to analyze call logs and messages. Email spam classification depends on your connected providerâ€™s capabilities.
